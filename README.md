#This project i have tried to implement the creation of digital clock using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
#i created the UI using the HTML
#styled the UI with the CSSS
#The functionality of the digital clock was done using javascript
#In Javascript we grap the IDs from the HTML with document.getElementById('hrs'), document.getElementById('mins'), document.getElementById('secs')
#now i set all the ids as follows const hrs , const mins, const secs
#function for getting hours const currentTime = new Date()
# for the time to refresh i used the function setTimeInterval();
#hope you follow this and give more improvement.
